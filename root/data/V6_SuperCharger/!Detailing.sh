# Detailing Script (SQLite VACUUM & REINDEX to optimize databases) created by -=zeppelinrox=-
#
# V6U9RC12T6
#
# When using scripting tricks, ideas, or code snippets from here, please give proper credit.
# There are many things may look simple, but actually took a lot of time, trial, and error to get perfected.
#
# This script can be used freely and can even be modified for PERSONAL USE ONLY.
# It can be freely incorporated into ROMs - provided that proper credit is given WITH a link back to the XDA SuperCharger thread.
# If you want to share it or make a thread about it, just provide a link to the main thread.
#      - This ensures that users will always be getting the latest versions.
# Prohibited: Any modification (excluding personal use), repackaging, redistribution, or mirrors of my work are NOT PERMITTED.
# Thanks, zeppelinrox.
#
# This will optimize (defrag, reindex, debloat) ALL sqlite3 databases found on your device.
# Resulting in faster database access and less ram usage for smoother performance.
#
# Props: avgjoemomma (from XDA) for the added reindex bit :)
#
# Note: You can change the "detailinterval" variable to any valid value that you want.
#       Valid values are from 1 to 9 (boots).
#       If 0, it won't run on boot.
#       If the value is invalid or missing, it defaults to running every 3rd boot.
#       Example: If you want it to run every 4th boot, make the line read "detailinterval=4".
#
clear
#
# For debugging, delete the # at the beginning of the following 2 lines, and check /data/Log_Detailing.log file to see what may have fubarred.
# set -x
